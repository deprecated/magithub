One obvious piece still missing is better interaction with GitHub issues, so
that'd be next on my TODO list.

(Reasons I haven't done it yet is firstly that I'm lazy and currently in a
down phase of my Elisp manic depression, and secondly that recently there have
been some signs of activity in that respect elsewhere[1], so I figured I'd
wait what becomes of that.)
